# Resonance Protocol – Open Source

Resonance Protocol is an open-source framework for **system integrity and trust verification**. It models systems as layered *hives*, using recursive hashing and Merkle trees to detect tampering.  

The project supports:
- **Passive Mode** – local integrity checks
- **Active Mode** – trust contracts between systems for resilient, evidence-based validation

This repo includes whitepapers, technical documentation, and example implementations.
