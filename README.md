# Resonance Protocol – Open Source

[Join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/H7WrZRDHNP)

Resonance Protocol is an open-source framework for system integrity and trust verification. It models systems as layered hives and uses recursive hashing and Merkle trees to detect tampering and establish trust.

## Modes
- Passive Mode – local integrity checks on a single system
- Active Mode – trust contracts between adjacent systems for coordinated defence

## Features
- Recursive hashing to baseline immutable state
- Merkle tree construction and verification
- Hive-based modelling across layers and components
- Local and distributed trust evaluation
- Tamper detection with clear audit artefacts
